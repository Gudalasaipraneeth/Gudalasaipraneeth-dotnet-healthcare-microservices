- Docker (optional)

**Steps:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gudalasaipraneeth/Gudalasaipraneeth-dotnet-healthcare-microservices.git
   cd Gudalasaipraneeth-dotnet-healthcare-microservices
   ```
2. Start MongoDB:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
   ```
3. Run each service in a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   cd src/microservices/MedicalServicesMicroservice
   dotnet run
   # In another terminal
   cd src/microservices/AppointmentMicroservice
   dotnet run
   # In another terminal
   cd src/microservices/PatientIdentityMicroservice
   dotnet run
   ```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- MongoDB 4.4+
- Docker (optional)

# Healthcare Management Platform

This project demonstrates hands-on experience in building a modern, secure, and scalable healthcare management system using microservices architecture.

## Key Skills & Technologies

- **.NET 8 Microservices**: Designed and implemented independent services for medical, appointment, and identity management.
- **Docker & Containerization**: All services are containerized for local and cloud deployment. Includes Docker Compose orchestration.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Used for storing patient, appointment, and service data with healthcare-specific schema design.
- **API Gateway (Ocelot)**: Centralized routing, authentication, and rate limiting for all APIs.
- **CI/CD**: Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines (sample GitHub Actions workflow included).
- **Unit & Integration Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage using xUnit and integration test projects for each microservice.
- **Security & Compliance**: JWT authentication, role-based access control, and HIPAA-inspired data handling practices.
- **Documentation**: Detailed API, deployment, and security documentation. Follows best practices for open source projects.

## Features Delivered

- Medical Services CRUD
- Patient registration and role management
- Appointment scheduling with conflict detection
- Role-based authentication for patients and staff
- Real-time notifications (planned)
- Medical record and prescription management (planned)

## How to Run Locally

**Requirements:**
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- MongoDB 4.4+
- Docker (for containers)

**Steps:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gudalasaipraneeth/Gudalasaipraneeth-dotnet-healthcare-microservices.git
   cd Gudalasaipraneeth-dotnet-healthcare-microservices
   ```
2. Start MongoDB:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
   ```
3. Run each service in a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   cd src/microservices/MedicalServicesMicroservice && dotnet run
   cd src/microservices/AppointmentMicroservice && dotnet run
   cd src/microservices/PatientIdentityMicroservice && dotnet run
   ```
4. Or use Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## API Overview

- Medical Services: `/api/medicalservices`
- Appointments: `/api/appointment`
- Patient Identity: `/api/patientidentity`

## Testing & Quality

- Run all tests:
  ```bash
  dotnet test
  ```
- Each microservice has its own test project for unit and integration tests.

## DevOps & CI/CD

- Sample GitHub Actions workflow for build, test, and deploy automation
- Docker Compose for local orchestration
- Environment variable support for secrets and configuration

## Security & Compliance

- JWT authentication and role-based authorization
- Secure handling of patient data (no real PHI in dev)
- HIPAA-inspired logging and audit trails
- Rate limiting and API gateway security

## Documentation

- API docs: See `API.md`
- Deployment: See `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Security: See `SECURITY.md`
- Contribution guide: See `CONTRIBUTING.md`
